## UX (User Experience) ##
---
<a name="project-goals"></a>
### Project Goals ###

The are many places on the internet to find recipes but their are not many that allow you to add your own recipes to swap and share 

The **goal** for this project is to to recreate a neighbourhood profile where friends, neighbours and relatives can swap and share their favourite recipes, simply and easily.<br>
A safe space to find inspiration with the items already in their fridge.

<a name="user-goals"></a>

## Testing ##
---

*I used **pep8online.com** to test my Python code validator with no issues - http://pep8online.com/checkresult
![pep8](static/img/pep8_test.png)
* I tested the python code with **Python Debugger** - https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/
![pdb](static/img/pdb_debugger.png)
* Also used this **Automated Testing** to test my flask applications - https://www.patricksoftwareblog.com/unit-testing-a-flask-application
![test_flask](static/img/test_flask.png)
* I used **Pylint** to lint my code by Linting my python code - http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/
![test_Pylint](static/img/pylint.png)
* I tested the responsiveness of the website by using the [**Google Chrome Developer Tool**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) as well as the plug-in **Unicorn Revealer** to control my overflow and the website [**Am I Responsive**](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/). 
![AmIresponsive](static/img/amIresponsive.png)
* I also tested my website on **different browsers and real devices** : **Iphone 6s, Ipad Pro 12", Ipad Mini, Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox and Samsung A70.**
* I used a first **dirty version** of this project on **Gitpod** and **refactored** my code **step by step** to remove any **useless classes**
* I tested my CSS file and my HTML files using [**CSS Validator**](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and [**HTML Validator**](https://validator.w3.org/) then fixed the issues needed to be fixed.
![test_Html](static/img/errors_val_w3.png)
![test_CSS](static/img/errors_val_w3_css.png)
* I tested every **functions** of my script.js using multiple **console.log** and checking for **errors** in the **Google Chrome console**.
* I passed my deployed app through **Lighthouse** with the follwoing results
![lighthouse](static/img/lighthouse.png)
* All pages passed the HTML,CSS and Python validator final test with no major issues.

**Responsiveness**

* **Implementation** 

    * I used **Bootstrap** as well as **flexbox and custom CSS media queries** to ensure that the website didn't break on all screen sizes.

![landingPage](static/img/home_page_response.png)
![landingPage](static/img/home_page_response2.png)

**Landing Page**

![landingPage](static/img/home_page.png)
![landingPage](static/img/home_page_footer.png)

* **Implementation** 

    * I wanted to keep it clean and neat with the landing page displaying the newest and latest recipes.<br>
    * The UI has been created in HTML5 and CSS3 and by using bootstrap all tiles are responsive on all screen sizes.<br>
    * As stated above, I wanted to recreate a neighbourhood profile where friends, neighbours and relatives can swap and share their favourite recipes, simply and easily<br>
    * User does not have to register if they just want to veiw recipes all recipes are free.<br>
    * Landing page was responsive and working as expected<br>

**Add register**

![Recipes](static/img/register.png) 

* **Implementation**

    * To start adding your own recipes you would need to register.<br>
    * Once registered you would have to log in<br>
    * User is informed if registeration is successful if flash message appears "user successfully added" else flashes "user name already used"<br>
    * Register and Log-in page was responsive and working as expected<br>

**Profile for normal users**

![Profile](static/img/profile.png) 
![Profile](static/img/profile_display.png) 

* **Implementation**

    * This is where the real fun begins, as a user you can <br>
        1. Thier **own profile** where their recipes come up first. <br>
        2. **Easily Add and Edit their own recipes** to the website. <br>
        3. **Have the possibility** to **upload pictures** <br>
        4. **Easily Delete their own recipes** if they no longer want to be on the website. <br>
    * Profile page was responsive and working as expected<br>

**Profile for Admin**

![Profile](static/img/profile_admin.png) 

* **Implementation**

    * This is where the Admin can see the listings page<br>
        1. Admin also has thier **own profile** where their recipes come up first. <br>
        2. From Listings Admin can **Easily Add and Edit all recipes** on the website. <br>
        3. **Have the possibility** to edit **upload pictures** which do not subscribe to the user agreement on the page <br>
        4. **Easily Delete any recipes** if the recipe does not prescribe to the user agreement and is no longer allowed on the website. <br>
    * Admin page was responsive and working as expected<br>

**Add recipes & Edit Recipes**

![Add Recipes](static/img/add_recipes.png) 
![Edit Recipes](static/img/edit_recipes.png) 

* **Implementation**

    * Both the add_recipe and the edit_recipe, have the same framework and based on the same template. <br>
    * edit_recipe does however pulls all the values from the DB so that User is aware what recipe they are editing <br>

    * This is the second step of the **CRUD** functionality, users can Add or edit the following: <br>
        1. Recipe name <br>
        2. Category <br>
        3. Prep time <br>
        4. Cooking Time <br>
        5. Difficulty <br>
        6. Serves <br>
        7. Ingredients <br>
        8. Add ingredient fields (add more then one or extra fields) <br>
        9. Instructions <br>
        10. Add Instructions fields (add more then one or extra fields)<br>

    * Also I have added a button for the user tochange mind and go back to profile. <br>
    * add_recipe and the edit_recipe pages was responsive and working as expected<br>

## Issues ##
---

**During development**

* I had a major issue with my MongoDB file whilst setting up the database because of this issue: <br>

**Issues**

I did not understand what was going on as my form was good and allowing me to add into the fields,<br> however when I submitted it was not sending it to the
database and saving it in the collections?

![RecipeForm](static/img/upload_recipe.png)

* To understand the error I went thorugh the code again and fixed it by creating "action" in the form to allow the method to "POST", later refactoring "input" to "add_recipes" for simplified reading<br>
* Then I refactored the code for one value such as ingredient & instruction, this name creates an array. This solved the issue for multiple variables to be added into the Database and when called listing all items in the array, and not seperating the values out as individual strings. <br>
* I also refactored the uppercase to lowercase, plurals and used_ to_seperate the variables wording rather. I refactored the numerical data into Intergers by using the int() option in python. <br>
* I also added timestamps and created_by to reference when the user is logged on, timestamps to allow the users to see the latest recipe added and created_by for users to veiw all their own recipes in their profile. <br>

![RecipeForm](static/img/upload_fix.png)
![RecipeForm](static/img/solve_input.png)

I was having an issue with the search elements once I had refactored the code for add_recipe and edit_recipe. Pagination being a big error, as I had added pagination to the index page.

![Indexes](static/img/search_issues.png)

* After many attempts I decided to rather add a seperate html dedicated to search results instead trying to forced the system to display the index page. <br>
* Once fixed the search was not bearing any results, very confused as no errors were appearing. Thus I assumed the issue must lie with the query. <br>
* And yes, I had forgotten to refactor the orginal indexes in MongoDB, how the user is able to search mulitple questions, name, category, ingredient and even any instruction. <br>

![Search](static/img/search_fixes.png)
![DB](static/img/index_refactor.png)

I also has few errors passing through my GitPod, basic house cleaning fixed most of the issues very quickly

![Html](static/img/indexErrors.png)
![PY](static/img/runpyErrors.png)

After my mentor call and my peer-code-review I realized that I needed to add some comments via Docstring for understanding of my code. <br>
and used this website to assist me Docstring conventions - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/ <br>

## Deployment ##
---
**RecipeCloud** was developed on **GitPod**, using **GitHub** to host the repository and deployed on **GitHub Pages**.
**Heroku** made the deployment extremely painless:

* Connect to [**Heroku**](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
* Click new/ **create new APP**
* Add the new app name and choose a region, In my case **Europe**
* While the app is being generated you will need to **Config Vars** by going to **settings**
* Config vars change the way your app behaves. In addition to creating your own, some add-ons come with their own
* In **Config vars** you need to add the **ID,PORT,MONGODB_NAME,MONGO_URI,SECRET_KEY**
* Now to **Deploy** find deployment method choose **GitHub** sign into your GitHub.
* Selected the repository **JustWhittaker/PRO3-RecipeCloud**
* In the **GitHub Pages** I selected **Master Branch** and **/root** in the dropdown menu and clicked **Save**
* Click on **"Automatic Deploys"** below 
* I waited 2 minutes.
* **The website is now live on https://recipe-cloud-pro.herokuapp.com/**.

**Cloning** No issues:

* Why do we is it important to be able to clone successfully first **Collaboration** with team members if you are working in a scrum and secondly **Assist** other developers to use my main project to grow their own version.
* In my repository **JustWhittaker/PRO3-RecipeCloud**, click on the **"Code** green button, **copy in clipboard the HTTPS link**, open your **IDE** and look through my files.
* The link : **https://github.com/JustWhittaker/PRO3-RecipeCloud.git**
